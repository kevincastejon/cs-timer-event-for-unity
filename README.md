# cs-timer-event-for-unity

### The TimerEvent package encapsulates the native System.Timers.Timer and the EventManager library together into a event-driven user friendly object.
### You can specify a delay in millisecond and a number of repeat or make it a endless loop
### You can then add event listeners to it to get the needed callbacks 

### Remade for Unity with prefabs and scene examples
